Hi there!
I need some advice on a good seafood restaurant
I would like some coffee with milk
I have no idea
How do you feel?
Are you working these days?
It is late, I am going home 
I think I will order a pizza
How about you?
Maybe we can chat tomorrow 
I am going next week on a trip
My mom called me
They have no respect for anyone
My phone is out of battery
I went to a restaurant with my wife and the service was terrible
They have no respect for anyone
I had a very bad experience at this restaurant 
They charged my twice for a service that they not even offered!
I am very upset
They don’t care about customers
I think it’s a waste of time
I don’t care about her
She is the worst person I’ve met so far
My bag was stolen
The food was awesome!
I love this music
That's my favourite place!
I am happy when I travel
It’s my birthday today!
I danced the whole night
The views up there are amazing
I got the best paper award!
My life is brilliant
I enjoy playing tennis with my friends
He surprised me yesterday with a cake
I won the lottery!! Hurra!
I mean these are uneducated people, what do you expect?
She the type of person I like to avoid
There are certain people I can’t stand
The food was ok but the place was dirty 
I have problems with these people
They never understand a word in English
I just lost my interest in this subject
I am not interested to know more 
I think there a plenty of people out there who can do a better job
He is this type of person who will try to get money out of anyone
He doesn’t know anything
I think I am far much better than him
