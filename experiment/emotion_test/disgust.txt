How may i address you?
I have been wanting to go there
I would like to share with you some of the bad customer service
When i was to call in, we went to the same restaurant
I felt sad
Yes, but i'm working on a few hours of work
I miss you
So i'm sorry for the bad experience
I'm feeling alright
I'm sorry for the bad experience
Oh my
I was in the hospital
I see.
I feel lost
Sorry to hear that
I don't even have one anymore
How did you feel?
So sorry that you are not able to resolve the issue
I'm sorry for the loss
So they have to accept that their customer service is not good
I know..
I don't care
She's just a bad influence
Sorry to hear that : (
It was sad
I'm listening to it too
I wish.
I wish you all the best of luck!
Happy birthday!
I felt so bad
I'm just sad to have that
I did the same thing in the first year
And the fact that you are still able to know what is happening in the end
I'm so sad
But i was like...
I felt like when you told me that, it was a bad experience
Sad
I see..
I know that feeling
The staff was not so good
They just want you to know that i'm not alone with myself
I feel you.
I know some people who had been bored
I guess that's the thing when you are with him?
I think they need to be more independent
I can't believe that there is a lot of people in the world
I really want to go back to work
You are very sad
