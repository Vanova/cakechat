How are you today?
Some seafood, salad, spices, chocolate, and a bad experience with my friends
It is not a real thing when i'm with my friends
I'm not a fan of the company
I feel like a little annoyed
I'm not working with the council family
You are still awake when your sleep?
I'm sorry for the bad experience with the customer service team
I feel so tired
I guess so
I'm going to the beach soon!
She was really mad when i asked her to share with me
I hate them
I hate the phone
I was sad when my dad had to pay for the service
I see..
I was there yesterday
I was in the bank as a customer
I would be upset if we were in a relationship
Although they do not have a customer service industry
I've heard that too
She's just a spoiled brat.
She can be more annoying than me
He was angry
I was like oh no!
I was listening to it in the end of the day, and the song is really annoying
I'm a psychologist recruited for this study.
I am jealous
Happy birthday!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I was so mad
The people who came to their website and said that they will not follow up
I was told that the company is very disrespectful and it's not that easy
The worst
I do not have a friend who has been with me for a while
So, he was just angry and upset?
I was really mad
I see..
She also said that i can't
But i am a psychologist recruited for this study
I was pretty annoyed with the food
U are so angry
I was so angry when it was a joke
That's so sad
I don't have a reason to be alone
I see...
He just wanted to join the club
He was my dad and i asked if you wanted to talk about him
I am jealous
